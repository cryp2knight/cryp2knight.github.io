Hey there ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my corner of the internet! Iâ€™m Daniel, a full-time **software engineer** ðŸ’» with a love for all things tech-related. When Iâ€™m not busy coding, you can usually find me out on my **bike** ðŸš², exploring the great outdoors ðŸŽ’ and getting some much-needed exercise.

Iâ€™m also a part-time **CS instructor** at Batangas State University, where I get to share my knowledge and experience with the next generation of tech-savvy students. And if that wasnâ€™t enough to keep me busy, Iâ€™m currently pursuing my masters in engineering in **Artificial Intelligence** at the University of the Philippines Diliman ðŸŽ“.

So whether youâ€™re here to check out some cool projects, read my latest blog posts, or just learn a little more about me, Iâ€™m glad you stopped by. Thanks for visiting! Oh, and before you go, hereâ€™s a random photo from my photo blog â€“ enjoy!
