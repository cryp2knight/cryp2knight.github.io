<h1>Quarantine Special: On the 3rd Wave of ECQ</h1>

<p><i><b>Brrrt.. Brrtttt...</b></i> What’s weirder than being awakened by this sound? As the confirmation of the 3rd wave of the ECQ echo from our radio, I can’t help but think of the activities that I have planned to be postponed again. But then I'm not surprised, with the current progress of this pandemic the situation might last for long. So I asked myself, <i>what should I do while I still have this much time to waste</i>? Two answers came up, first, learn Russian, and second, make my website and start blogging. Yeah yeah, I know that I can do both ;)</p>

<p><img src="./images/twitter.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"></p>
<p>So I searched for tutorials about free web hosting and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HPYsDTk17A">GitHub Pages</a> is the best fit for what I'm about to do. I grabbed my laptop and started building my simple webpage. It took me 2 hours to <i>copy-pasta</i> some codes and finish my content. After publishing the site, I was satisfied with the results so I started adding this to every social media profile that I have. Now, I have a so-called <a href="https://cryp2knight.github.io/daniel">personal website</a> that I could share with anyone. But I also want to know if people are cool enough to visit and view my page. And that’s when I headed to Google Analytics.</p>

<p>Again, after watching some youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9ExoBi7AXw&t=6s">tutorials</a> I discovered the tempting power of Google Analytics. Although I have some active projects that are using Google products like FireBase which comes with Google analytics I have not focused on the analytics part for the reason that most of my projects are unfinished and still in the development phase. I was amazed that you can track the page views of your webpage with just a few lines of code in google analytics. As I was excited and hyped to see that the number of my page-views increases, I sent the link of my site to my friends and group chats I was in. Sadly, only a few of them <em>(in this context few means less than five)</em> have visited my page <em>(as what the data shows)</em>.</p>

<p>To end this day, I decided to finish my first blog. At first, I don’t know what to write about because I was thinking of a cool-topic for this kick-off. But then I was told <em>(by myself)</em> <b>“why just don’t write about your day <em>(and your low-key frustrations)</em>”</b> and I did. I hope you enjoyed reading my first blog and I wish you the best for the days to come.</p>
